//cau1
write a complete program meeting the following requirements
a.input 1 positive integer n and K so that 0<n<1000; if the input value is not compliant to the rule, ask the user to input again until the rule is satisfied
b.print out the sum S=11+22+33+....+nn 
 example: N=4 -> S=11+22+33+44=1000
          N=12 -> S=11+22+33+1010+1111+1212=3828


//cau2
write a complete program meeting the following requirements
a. input an integer array with N elements, the output that array onto the console screen
b. find and print out the element that contains most digits with 0 value. In case there are more than one such elements, print out the last one
  example: 200 35 80 22 1010 7   ->   1010 (2zero digits)
c.sort the array so that prime elements are in descending order, while other elements remain unchanged. Then, print out the resulting array 
   example:  5 8 3 9 6 7 1
        ->   7 8 5 9 6 3 1

//cau3
write a complete program meeting the following requirements
a. declare and input values for a NxM matrix which contains integers, then output it onto the console screen
b. check if the input matrix is an "X" matrix or not, with the definition tha an S matrix is a square matrix in which all the elements on 2 diagonas are non-zero and all the other elements must be zeroes
  example: -3  0  0  0  3
           0  5  0  -2  0
           0  0  4  0  0
           2  0  0  0  6
           output: yes

//cau4
write a complete program meeting the following requirements
a.declare and input value for a string containing no more than 200 characters
calculate and print out the greatest NON-NEGATIVE NUMBER that appears in the string
  example: input: Class 12A1 school year 2022-2023
           output: 2023
